<h1>SuperComputing Summer Camp</h1>

<p>Taking advantage of the Internet and high speed networks available today, one can exploit high performance computing infrastructures from anywhere, even located in the middle of the nature.

SC-Camp is an initiative of researchers inspired by this idea that offers undergraduate and master students state-of-the-art lectures and programming practical sessions upon High Performance and Distributed Computing topics. SC-Camp is a non-profit event, addressed to all students including those that lack of financial backup. Usually, students applying in due time receive a partial or total grant, including meals, accomadation, lectures access, and programming challenges. This year the event will be hosted by ABACUS-CINVESTAV EDOMEX near Marquesa National Park, State of Mexico, between Mexico City and Toluca.</p>
