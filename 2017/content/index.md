## School Mission

SC-Camp is a summer school and non-profit event about Super Computing and Distributed Systems. It proposes a series of courses around the thematic of High Performance Computing with an important focus on practical sessions (more than half of the time). It targets Master and PhD students in the field of Computer Sciences, Engineering and any other fields that could benefit from HPC (Physics & Material Sciences, Biology/Bio-Bioinformatics, Finance, etc.). 


Taking advantage of the Internet and high speed networks available today, one can exploit high performance computing infrastructures from anywhere, even located in the middle of the nature. SC-Camp is an initiative of researchers inspired by this idea that offers undergraduate and master students state-of-the-art lectures and programming practical sessions upon High Performance and Distributed Computing topics. It is an itinerant school, bringing the HPC knowledge to a different place every year.

SC-Camp is a non-profit event, addressed to all students including those that lack of financial backup, so we try to keep the cost for the students as low as possible.
 

## Content

The summer school focus on the following topics:

- Distributed Systems: Grid/Cluster/Cloud/Volunteer Computing
- Distributed parallel programming with MPI
- Shared Memory parallel programming with OpenMP
- Accelerators: GPUs with CUDA, XeonPhi
- Debugging and Performance Optimization
- Data Analysis with R
- Resource/Job Management & Scheduling
- Big Data


## Organization

SC-Camp 2017 features 5 days of scientific sessions and 1/2 leisure day with an organized activity (e.g., hiking). During the lectures several programming practical sessions will be held.

We welcome applications of undergraduate (preferable in Senior year) or master students from all areas of Engineering and Computational Sciences with strong interest upon High Performance and Distributed Computing. Due to the advanced content of lectures some basic notions of Parallel and Distributed Computing along with programming skills are desirable. All courses and lectures will be held in English, thus a good knowledge of English -both oral and written- is mandatory. The scientific and steering committee will evaluate the application forms based on the applicant's scientific background and their motivation letter. This year, as the former year, we expect to accept 20 - 40 students.


## Registration fee

COST: *to be announced*. The registration fee includes lunches and access to all scientific lectures and practical sessions.
