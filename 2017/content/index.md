## School Mission

Taking advantage of the Internet and high speed networks available today, one can exploit high performance computing infrastructures from anywhere, even located in the middle of the nature.

SC-Camp is an initiative of researchers inspired by this idea that offers undergraduate and master students state-of-the-art lectures and programming practical sessions upon High Performance and Distributed Computing topics. SC-Camp is a non-profit event, addressed to all students including those that lack of financial backup. Usually, students applying in due time receive a partial or total grant, including meals, accomadation, lectures access, and programming challenges.


## Content

The summer school focus on the following topics:

* Parallel Programming
* Multiprocessors Programming
* Distributed Systems
  * Cluster Computing
  * Grid Computing
  * Cloud Computing
  * Volunteer Computing
  * Hybrid and GPU Programming
* Resource/Job Management & Scheduling
* Virtualisation
* Fault tolerance
* Green Computing
* Performance Evaluation

## Organization

SC-Camp 2017 features 5 days of scientific sessions and 1 leisure day with an organized activity (e.g., hiking). During the lectures several parallel programming practical sessions will be held.

We welcome applications of undergraduate (preferable in Senior year) or master students from all areas of engineering and science with strong interest upon High Performance and Distributed Computing. Due to the advanced content of lectures some basic notions of Parallel and Distributed Computing along with programming skills are desirable. All courses and lectures will be held in English, thus a good knowledge of English -both oral and written- is mandatory. The scientific and steering committee will evaluate the application forms based on the applicant's scientific background and their motivation letter. This year, as the former year, we expect to accept 20 - 40 students.


## Registration fee

COST: *to be announced*. The registration fee includes accommodation, food and access to all scientific lectures.
